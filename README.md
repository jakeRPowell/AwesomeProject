# My First React Native App
This is my first React Native app, created as a part of my journey to learn mobile app development. The app is a simple goal-setting app that allows users to add and view their goals.

## Features
- Display a list of added goals
- Add new goals by opening a modal with a form
- Close the modal by adding a new goal or tapping outside the modal

## Getting Started
Prerequisites
- Node.js
- Expo CLI

## Installing
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jakeRPowell/MyFirstReactNativeApp-.git
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd MyFirstReactNativeApp
npx install
npx expo start
```
Open the app in the Expo app
on your mobile device, or run it in a simulator or emulator on your computer.
Usage

When the app starts, you will see a list of your previously added goals (if any).
To add a new goal, tap the "Add Goal" button at the bottom of the screen.
This will open a modal with a form to add a new goal.
Type in your new goal and tap "Add Goal" to add it to the list.
Alternatively, you can tap outside the modal to close it without adding a new goal.

## Technologies Used
- React Native
- Expo

Acknowledgments
This app was created with the help of online tutorials and resources, primarily the Academind react native course on Udemy. Thank you to the React Native and Expo communities for their contributions and support.
